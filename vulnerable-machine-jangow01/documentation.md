First need to discover the host IP address.

```shell
ifconfig
```

```bash
enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.0.2.15  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.0.2.255
        inet6 fe80::d55a:76fc:6609:1664  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:4b:43:b1  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 12874  bytes 16831434 (16.0 MiB)

        TX packets 5737  bytes 479575 (468.3 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

enp0s8: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.10.10.13  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.10.10.255
        inet6 fe80::d208:b51b:32a6:3278  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:1b:c4:cb  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 14  bytes 2971 (2.9 KiB)

        TX packets 291  bytes 18720 (18.2 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 4  bytes 240 (240.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4  bytes 240 (240.0 B)

```

In my case, there is to network interface. One for NATing and another for Host-Only network. For Host-Only network, I have used the IP block: `10.10.10.0/24` in the network interface enp0s8.

&#x20;Then, we need to perform the network discovery to fine the IP address of other host.

```bash
netdiscover -i enp0s8 -r 10.10.10.0/24
```

Here the targeted IP is `10.10.10.14`.

Now, we perform the network scan to detect which ports are open. It is the essential part of the enumeration process. For this we are going to use the nmap tools.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.14
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>nmap port scanning</p></figcaption></figure>

After scanning the port we have found that, two ports are open. i.e&#x20;

```bash
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18
```

Here, port 21/TCP running FTP service & Port 80/TCP running HTTP service.

Now, we tried to access the FTP service using default credential. THis FTP service might be vulnerable to FTP anonymous login, whare usrename is anoymous and password is anonymous.
